- "given access" docs just work
- auto-responder from posting the link
- customer documentation source
- health check docs

### Monitoring:

- detecting errors before the customer tells us
- are things monitored?
- where are the monitored?
- health check notification/alert

### Automation:

- auto-responder post customer-facing document
- health check deployment/configuration

**Self-service == "Profit"**

Are there any specific targets to go after?
